## Projects
### Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
- Performed exploratory data analysis and visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib on mall customer data to understand patterns in income, age, and spending scores.
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clustering using K-Means to segment customers into meaningful groups.
- Optimized number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and visualized cluster centers across different dimensions for business insights.
- Applied StandardScaler and one-hot encoding for multivariate modeling, improving clustering accuracy and feature scaling.
- Exported and interpreted final cluster results for use in marketing strategies, customer targeting, and persona development.

### Data Masking & Privacy Protection on Customer Data
- Developed a Python pipeline to anonymize and tokenize sensitive data in a real-world customer dataset (Excel), using libraries like Faker, hashlib, and pandas.
- Masked identifiers such as usernames, emails, and credit card numbers while preserving data format for usability.
- Applied randomization to date fields (e.g. birthdates and registration dates) using timedelta and relativedelta to simulate realistic but private data.
- Tokenized employer and job information using SHA-256 hashing for secure pseudonymization.
- Ensured full compliance with data privacy principles by replacing all personally identifiable information (PII) while maintaining analytical value.

### End-to-End SQL & Power BI Dashboard Project
- Designed and implemented a relational database using SQL to manage and query structured data effectively.
- Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI, integrating SQL queries to visualize key performance indicators and trends.
- Applied data cleaning and transformation techniques to ensure data integrity and accuracy in visual representations.
- Utilized DAX functions within Power BI to create calculated columns and measures, enhancing analytical capabilities.
- Demonstrated the ability to translate complex datasets into actionable insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making processes.
